Hello? My name is Eunhee Park and I am a doctoral student in the Department of Community Health Sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. I received the Master of Public Health degree from University of Hawaii and Bachelor of Arts in Political Sciences and International Relations from Sookmyung Women’s University in Seoul, South Korea. My research focuses on intersection of gender iniquities, related violence, and women’s reproductive health. My current academic advisor Dr. Jennifer Wagman is an internationally recognized leader in the HIV and Intimate Partner Violence field. My research with Dr. Jennifer Wagman at UCLA focuses on the intersections of social determinants of health, gender based violence and STDs among Black and Hispanic women in California.

I am aspired to promote gender equity and empower women’s right through my research. My research interests center around gender inequities, related violence, and women’s access to health care services. I am interested in methods and strategies to facilitate the uptake of evidence-based practices related to social determinants of health, violence, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV. The academic training and research experience I have are related to multiple public health disciplines including, global health, violence against women, reproductive health and rights, and STDs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV). 

Biosketch
======

As an undergraduate, I was able to conduct research with Dr. Mark Delancey on the HIV prevention programs conducted by international aid agencies in Rwanda. As a master student, I studied the obesity issue among native Hawaiian children living in rural area and assisted a clinic-based intervention evaluation program for Dr. May Okihiro, a pediatrician who served native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities. Under Dr. Clauido Nigg’s guidance, I conducted a theory-based multiple health behavior change (MHBC) research to find out research proprieties for the underserved population and publish a paper highlighting the importance of sustainability, dissemination ,and translation of effective MHBC research findings for implementation. As a research associate at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at UC San Diego, I worked closely with Drs. Jamila Stockman, Laramie Smith, and Jennifer Wagman on implementing evidence-based programs addressing gender inequities, particularly for women living with HIV. I was the first author of the paper, structural barriers to women’s sustained engagement in HIV care in Southern California, published in AIDS and Behavior on April, 2020. My current academic advisor Dr. Jennifer Wagman is an internationally recognized leader in the HIV and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) field and has an extensive record for training pre and postdoctoral fellows. As a doctoral student in the school of public health at UCLA, my research with Dr. Jennifer Wagman focused on the intersections of social determinants of health, gender based violence and STDs among women living in central California. 

Contribution to Science
------
**Early Career**: My early career contributions were focused on applying my knowledge of statistics to improving the program evaluation of a clinic-based behavioral intervention program to reduce childhood obesity in rural Hawaii. My particular role in the project was to organize data to identify prevalence of childhood obesity by racial groups, and make reports to the clinicians and practitioners who implement the program. This experience led me to study the implementation science approach to address gaps between research and practice, particularly programs for the underserved population.

**Graduate Career**: My graduate research contributions focused on intersections between social determinants of health and HIV. Results from my research were highly relevant as they provided new details into the existing Ryan White HIV program coverage, and allowed for further extrapolations into the development of assistance addressing structural barriers.

**Professional Career**: As a staff research associate at the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health in the UC San Diego School of Medicine and the Center for Gender Equity, my research has provided an evidence for implementation of effective gender-based violence prevention programs and its adaptation to different countries. Previous studies have shown the program effectiveness in urban Uganda setting and my research is focused on the rural Tanzania setting. Such intervention programming efforts were examined in the national governance-level and I reviewed all foreign aid programs related to health and examined its effectiveness.
