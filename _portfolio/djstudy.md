title: "Double Jeopardy: Experiences of sexual violence and anti-Asian racism among AAPI students"
excerpt: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, xenophobia against the AAPI population has increased dramatically. Close to 40% of participants from a national study conducted in 2020 said
racist and racially insensitive views about Asians have increased since the start of pandemic (Pew Research Center 2020). With the rapid increase of reported hate-crimes,
it is likely that the occurrence of sexual violence against Asians has increased as well, simultaneously creating hostile environments that deter survivors from seeking support.
Our study aims to understand the links between sexual violence, anti-Asian racism, mental health, and help seeking behaviors among AAPI college students."

### Double Jeopardy: AAPI Students’ Experiences of Sexual Violence and Xenophobia during COVID-19

The Double Jeopardy Study examines intersections of sexual violence and sexual harassment (SVSH), and anti-Asian racism and discrimination (in both covert and overt forms) that University of California (UC) students from Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (ANHPI) communities have experienced.

We utilize mixed methods including 1) surveys and semi-structured in-depth interviews and 2) two transmedia storytelling methods including photo-voice and installation art.

We assess types of SVSH and gendered microaggressions against AAPI women, and mental and physical health among AAPI undergraduate and graduate students. 

We also examine changes after COVID-19 pandemic. Our research methods are informed by intersectional, community engaged frameworks guided by trauma-informed practices and survivor-centered principles.
