title: "Double Jeopardy: Experiences of sexual violence and anti-Asian racism among Asian American, Asian International, and Pacific Islander students "
excerpt: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, xenophobia against the Asian population has increased dramatically. Close to 40% of participants from a national study conducted in 2020 said
racist and racially insensitive views about Asians have increased since the start of pandemic (Pew Research Center 2020). With the rapid increase of reported hate-crimes,
it is likely that the occurrence of sexual violence against Asians has increased as well, simultaneously creating hostile environments that deter survivors from seeking support.
Accordingly, unaddressed mental health concerns among Asian Pacific Islander (API) survivors have an adverse impact on the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)
community as a whole. Our study aims to understand the links between sexual violence, anti-Asian racism, mental health, and help seeking behaviors among API populations. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
