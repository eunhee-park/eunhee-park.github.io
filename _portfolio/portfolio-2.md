title: "Double Jeopardy: Experiences of sexual violence and anti-Asian racism among Asian American, Asian International, and Pacific Islander students "
excerpt: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, xenophobia against the Asian population has increased dramatically. Close to 40% of participants from a national study conducted in 2020 said
racist and racially insensitive views about Asians have increased since the start of pandemic (Pew Research Center 2020). With the rapid increase of reported hate-crimes,
it is likely that the occurrence of sexual violence against Asians has increased as well, simultaneously creating hostile environments that deter survivors from seeking support.
Accordingly, unaddressed mental health concerns among Asian Pacific Islander (API) survivors have an adverse impact on the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI)
community as a whole. Our study aims to understand the links between sexual violence, anti-Asian racism, mental health, and help seeking behaviors among API populations.

#### Double Jeopardy: Asian International Students’ Experiences of Sexual Violence and Xenophobia during COVID-19

Despite the high proportion of Asian international students in the U.S. education system, including across all University of California (UC) campuses, there is a gap in the research literature on the intersecting identities of being a foreigner in U.S. and the ascribed identity of being Asian. Additionally, little is known about how these identities affect risk for exposure to sexual violence and practice of key help-seeking behaviors. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian students’ risk for sexual violence and sexual harassment (SVSH) on college campuses has increased due to anti-Asian xenophobia and social isolation. Moreover, visa restrictions on the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) enforced by the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) may inhibit international students’ willingness to seek essential SVSH advocacy and support services available on and off campus.

Previous UC Speaks Up study findings indicate there are substantial gaps in the availability of culturally appropriate and accessible SVSH services for international UC students, i.e., students enrolled for credit at a UC campus on a non-immigrant visa status (without a valid green card). The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Study is to build on these findings by exploring Asian international students’ experiences related to SVSH during their time in U.S., both before and during COVID-19. Our research aims to specifically examine xenophobia-related trauma, help seeking methods, barriers and facilitators to accessing support services, and if there are added vulnerabilities due to COVID-19 among Asian international student survivors of SVSH.

The goal of the Double Jeopardy Study is to open the conversation about Asian international students’ experiences of SVSH during the pandemic, and use evidence-based practice to improve services to help students access supportive resources. We stand with survivors and advocate for student- and survivor-centered research and practice.

We are seeking international Asian student survivors of SVSH who are 18 years or older to participate in a short survey and a confidential, 1-hour Zoom interview. SVSH includes sexual assault, sexual harassment, stalking, dating and/or intimate partner violence. Students from all 10 UC campuses are eligible to participate.

**We are looking for participants who are:**

1. Aged 18 years and over
2. Identifying as a woman* 
_Individuals of sexual and racial minorities are at higher risk of experiencing sexual violence and other types of harm. This study will be inclusive of both ciswomen and transwomen in our study population and we do not exclude any women because of their assigned sex at birth._
4. Being a citizen of one of the East Asian countries
5. Attending (or, graduated past 12 months) one of the University of California campuses, and
6. Having experienced sexual violence and/or sexual harassment (example: sexual violence, sexual harassment, intimate partner violence/dating violence, stalking) while enrolled as a student.

Once your eligibility is confirmed from the screening survey, we will send you a link to access the full survey.

The full survey will take around 15-20 mins to finish.

Upon completion, you will receive a 5 dollar Amazon e-gift code.

> We will also ask you if you are willing to participate in a follow-up interview, which will last about an hour. Interview participants will receive an additional $25 gift card upon completion. Interview participants will have an option to choose English, Chinese (Mandarin), and/or Korean. Other languages can be accommodated as needed.

Your participation may help us to understand help-seeking behavior after sexual violence and other types of interpersonal abuse and generate ideas for tailored services to meet international students’ needs.

This study is approved by the UCLA Office of the Human Research Protection Program. Your participation in this study will be used only for the purposes of this research. Your information will be kept confidential.
