_data motherhood_, is named after <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/"> Data Feminism (D'lgnazio and Klein, 2020) </a>that presents a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics from an intersectional feminist perspective. They propose following 7 approaches: examine power, challenge power, evaluate emotion and embodiment, rethinking binaries and hierarchies, embrace pluralism, consider context, make labor visible.  

I am a public health researcher focusing on women's health, particularly sexual and reproductive health. My interest naturally extends to maternal and child health. I see the journey of motherhood is a life-long process that could oppress and liberate people, and I'd illustrate the various dimensions and processes of women's health through data visualization incorporating aforementioned approaches.
