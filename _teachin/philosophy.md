One of my main objectives as an educator in public health is to foster an overall appreciation and recognition for the discipline, especially for students in other areas of public or clinical health. For students planning a career in global and community health, I anticipate cultivating and refining the critical thinking, communication, and methodological skills necessary for these future public health workers to be successful in their research and careers so that they could then go on to improve the lives of many more people.
My personal experience with learning the theories, concepts, and models from the social and behavioral sciences and epidemiological methods has involved a mix of traditional lectures and applied practice, and I intend to incorporate both of these processes in my own teaching. I can utilize various teaching methods (lectures, online resources, small group projects, laboratories, etc.) to tailored to the various learning styles of the students, which can be gauged through solicitation of feedback in the form of course evaluations and surveying students early in the semester, as well as through performance on assignments and exams and class participation. 

The reality, though, is that global and community health is a broad field and no amount of coursework can cover all the content, so focusing on teaching the methodology and developing the critical thinking and communication skills necessary for students to be successful in their own preferred area of research is most important. Since students have a variety of health interests, which are often fueled by their own personal experiences with certain diseases, finding what appeals to them and developing assignments, discussions, and examples tailored to their passions is the best strategy to learn these skills. To enhance the learning, it is vital that an educator recognizes students’ different learning styles and incorporates a variety of teaching strategies. I applied this idea while a graduate student instructor for foundational courses (e.g., Community Health Sciences, Program Planning, Research, and Evaluation in Community Health Sciences) in the Master of Public Health program to the 1st year graduate students between 2021 and 2023. The Best Teaching Assistant Award is a testament to my dedication, effectiveness, and excellence in teaching and optimizing the learning experiences for students. I have consistently received positive feedback from both students and faculty for my ability to clarify complex concepts.

While it is vital to employ reliable teaching strategies in the classroom, I strongly believe that the attitude I maintain while in the classroom greatly enhances the learning. My general approach to teaching is to possess a genuine care and respect for my students and to maintain a constant curiosity and growth for knowledge of the field. The great impact a professor’s teaching compassion can have on students was evident to me while I conduct research related to sexual violence prevention and response efforts on college campuses. Numerous interviews and focus group discussions informed me that professor recognizing the students’ anxiety and making oneself available for students are so important to create safe and conducive learning environment. 

I also believe that a good teacher is one who is not only competent in their field, but is also always striving to learn more. Proficiency in one’s field fosters confidence, which is important when one needs to exhibit authority over a class. However, I also feel that educators who recognize that they do not know everything (and are not ashamed to admit it), but who aim to constantly improve their own knowledge can better relate to students because they continue to be students themselves. The field of social and behavioral health and community health is constantly growing, and my research focus on the developmental origins of disease and health is an area that is rapidly growing. I recognize that I still have a lot to learn and I would like to not only continue to make contributions to my field, but to continue to inform students about the newest methodologies. The field of public health is humbling and underappreciated. 

As students and professionals become absorbed in the methodology, terminology and content, it is easy to lose sight of the overarching motivation to improve people’s health. I believe that approaching my teaching with compassion, respect, patience, and curiosity ensures that my students will garner the same attitude when they are doing their own research or in their own interactions with people as public health professionals. development.  

Teaching Interest
======
I have a broad set of teaching interest and am willing to teach courses than extend beyond my core research focus on violence, substance use, and sexually transmitted diseases and HIV. Below is a sample of the courses that I am interested in teaching:
* Community Health Sciences
* Global Health
* Needs Assessment and Program Evaluation
* Immigrant Health
* Qualitative Research Methodology
* Gender-Based Violence
